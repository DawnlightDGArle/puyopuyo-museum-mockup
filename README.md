# Puyo Puyo Museum Mock Up
A mock up recreation of the home page of the old Puyo Puyo Museum site, with some minor changes, before the site shut down in 2007

I wanted to recreate the site after coming across mention of it on Puyo Nexus and becoming intrigued by what the exact site was that essentially contributed to Puyo Nexus's eventual creation. I managed to find the url to the site, stuffed it into Wayback Machine and found the site. I then decided it would be cool to recreate the site's home page using HTML5 and CSS3 and thus, that is how this mock up project was born.

A link to the site currently live if you'd like to check out a live link to the mock up can be found here: https://puyopuyo-museum.netlify.app/

I hope to expand upon this recreation in the future since I thought Erikku's work at the time was super cool and I want to bring that kind of magic back and restore as much of the site through a live mock up as possible so that way, more modern Puyo Puyo fans get a chance to easily access a relic of old Puyo history.
